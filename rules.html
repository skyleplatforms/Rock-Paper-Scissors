  <title>RULES-Rock Paper Scissors</title>

    <!--<pre>-->          RULES<br><br>
       To play rock paper scissors, two players simultaneously show one of three hand shapes: rock, paper, or scissors. <br>
  The winner is determined by the following rules: <br>
        Rock beats scissors: A rock can blunt scissors <br>
        Scissors beats paper: Scissors can cut paper <br>
        Paper beats rock: Paper can cover rock <br>
        Tie: If both players show the same shape, the round is a tie and is repeated <br> <br> <br>

       In summary, the game is rock-paper-scissors plus a fourth move called "well". <br>
  Well is essentially a strong rock: it defeats scissors and loses to paper, but also defeats rock.<br>
  The "solution" is to recognize that since rock is never better than well, you should just never play rock.<br><br><br>

       Once again, Rock wins against scissors; paper wins against rock; and scissors wins against paper. <br>
  If both players throw the same hand signal, it is considered a tie, and play resumes until there is a clear winner.<br><br><br>

                                   Happy playing!!
